Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Constraints:
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
