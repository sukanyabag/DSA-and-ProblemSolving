/*  
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time 
(in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, 
return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

Constraints:
1 <= bills.length <= 105
bills[i] is either 5, 10, or 20.
