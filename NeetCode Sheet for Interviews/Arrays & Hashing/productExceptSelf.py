'''
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 
Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [1] * (len(nums))

        prefix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]
        postfix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] *= postfix
            postfix *= nums[i]
        return res
