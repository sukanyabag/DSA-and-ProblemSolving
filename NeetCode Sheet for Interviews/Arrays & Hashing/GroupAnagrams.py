'''
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Constraints:
1 <= strs.length <= 104
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return ans.values()
