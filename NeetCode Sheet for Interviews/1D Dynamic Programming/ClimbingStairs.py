'''
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 45

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3:
            return n
        n1, n2 = 2, 3

        for i in range(4, n + 1):
            temp = n1 + n2
            n1 = n2
            n2 = temp
        return n2
